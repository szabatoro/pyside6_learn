# Small projects I'm making to learn Pyside6

- tempconverter - a simple fahrenheit-celsius converter
- ytdownloader - a simple frontend for yt-dlp
- pacman-front - first attempt at messing with qt mvc and pyalpm, half-baked
- pac-up - a bit more polished than the first attempt, calls pacman directly instead of messing with the badly documented pyalpm package, also AI use kept to a minimum this time
